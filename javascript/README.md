# Reverse an Array
- Class 01 : 08-10-2020

## Challenge
- The challenge is to reverse an array of any length without using any methods that are built in to JavaScript. 

## Approach & Efficiency
- My approach with solving this challenge was to start at the end of the array and work forward from there by decrementing the index. With each position we can push that value to the new array. By doing it this way, it will work with an array of any length.
