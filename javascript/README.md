# Reverse an Array
- Class 01 : 08-10-2020

## Challenge
- The challenge is to reverse an array of any length without using any methods that are built in to JavaScript. 

## Approach & Efficiency
- My approach with solving this challenge was to start at the end of the array and work forward from there by decrementing the index. With each position we can push that value to the new array. By doing it this way, it will work with an array of any length.

# Shift and Array
- Class 02 : 08-11-2020

## Challenge
- The challenge is to shift an array in that the function will take in an array and an individual number, and add that individual number to the middle of the existing array. 

## Approach & Efficiency
- My thought is to find the length of the array, divide it by two to find the middle, and *somehow* retrieve that index number and insert the value in front of it.
